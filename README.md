## Lab: File Reading and Writing (45 min)

Create an app that quizzes users on superhero trivia. Open the `Superheroes` [starter code](/Week4/Code/2-Tuesday/Exception-Handling/Starter-Code/SuperHeroes) and start working from there.

Your app reads the superhero info from an `input.txt` file and stores it in an `ArrayList`. Based on the answers, keep count of every right and wrong one. If the number of right answers is greater than wrong ones, declare the user a winner and write the user's name and the result of the quiz in an `output.txt` file.

You can refer to the solution code [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0).

## Conclusion (5 min)

Exceptions are an important part of keeping our apps running when problems occur. Sometimes, these problems — such as certain file I/O or networking situations — are out of our hands, and we need to be prepared to handle them.
